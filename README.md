### Predicting credit default of payments using Neural Networks (NN) and Visualizing how NNs help to separate non-linear data 

### <ins> Problem Statement
The analysis undertakes a dual approach:
> Visualizes how artifical neural networks perform significantly better to separate non-linear classes
> Classify whether an individual is more likely to default on a credit card payment or not

 ### <ins> Methodology
 
> For the visualization, the project uses a dummy data from sklearn datasets - make_circles to graphically display how NN are deployed to segregate non-linear data
> For the classification task, the project uses credit default payment dataset to build three models - Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, undertake hyperparamter tuning of the models and then select the best performing model using evaluaation metrics for classification like precision , recall, F1s score, ROC curve etc.
