### Predicting credit default of payments using Neural Networks (NN) and Visualizing how NNs help to separate non-linear data 

### <ins> Problem Statement
The analysis undertakes a dual approach:
1. Visualizes how artificial neural networks perform significantly better to separate non-linear classes
2.  Classify whether an individual is more likely to default on a credit card payment or not

 ### <ins> Methodology
 
1. For the visualization, the project uses dummy data from sklearn datasets - make_circles to graphically display how NN are deployed to segregate non-linear data
2. For the classification task, the project uses a credit default payment dataset to build three models - Neural Network, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, undertake hyperparameter tuning of the models and then select the best-performing model using evaluation metrics for classification like precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, etc.
